### poll_next { #bytewax.testing.poll_next }

`testing.poll_next(source, timeout=timedelta(seconds=5))`

Repeatedly poll an input source until it returns a value.

You'll want to use this in unit tests of sources when there's some
non-determinism in how items are read.

Args:

    source: To call `source.next()` on.

Returns:

    The next item found.

Raises:

    TimeoutError: If no item was returned within the timeout.
